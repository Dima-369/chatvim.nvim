**Bake Time**: 25-30 minutes  
**Total Time**: About 1 hour (including cooling)

#### **Ingredients**:
**For the Cake**:
- 2 ¬æ cups (330g) all-purpose flour
- 1 ¬Ω teaspoons baking powder
- ¬Ω teaspoon baking soda

#### **Equipment**:
- Two 8-inch (20cm) round cake pans
- Mixing bowls
- Whisk or electric mixer

- Cooling rack

---

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pans**:
   - Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
   - Grease and lightly flour two 8-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**:
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugar**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together with an electric mixer (or by hand) on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.
   - Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**:
   - Add half of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix until just combined.
   - Pour in the milk and mix again.
   - Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until the batter is smooth. Be careful not to overmix.

5. **Bake the Cake**:
   - Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.

6. **Make the Vanilla Buttercream Frosting**:
   - In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with an electric mixer until creamy, about 1-2 minutes.
   - Gradually add the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing on low speed until fully combined.
   - Add the vanilla extract, a pinch of salt (if using), and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream or milk. Beat on medium-high speed until the frosting is light and fluffy. Add more cream or milk if the frosting is too thick.

7. **Assemble the Cake**:
   - Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a generous layer of frosting on top.
   - Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream.
   - Decorate as desired with sprinkles, fruit, or other toppings.

#### **Tips**:
- **Storage**: Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days.
- **Variations**: Add lemon zest or cocoa powder to the batter for a different flavor. You can also use chocolate frosting or whipped cream instead of buttercream.
- **Room Temperature Ingredients**: Using room temperature eggs, butter, and milk helps create a smoother batter and a fluffier cake.

### **Classic Chocolate Cake Recipe**
**Servings**: 8-10  
**Prep Time**: 20 minutes  
**Bake Time**: 25-30 minutes  
**Total Time**: About 1 hour (including cooling)

#### **Ingredients**:
**For the Cake**:
- 1 ¬æ cups (220g) all-purpose flour
- ¬æ cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ¬Ω teaspoons baking soda
- ¬Ω teaspoon salt
- 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk, at room temperature
- ¬Ω cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup (240ml) boiling water

**For the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting**:
- 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 3 ¬Ω cups (420g) powdered sugar (confectioners' sugar)
- ¬Ω cup (45g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2-3 tablespoons heavy cream or milk
- A pinch of salt (optional)

#### **Equipment**:
- Two 8-inch (20cm) round cake pans
- Mixing bowls
- Whisk or electric mixer
- Spatula
- Cooling rack

---

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pans**:
   - Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
   - Grease and lightly flour two 8-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the granulated sugar and set aside.

3. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**:
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**:
   - Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. The batter will be thick.
   - Carefully pour in the boiling water and stir slowly until the batter becomes smooth. (The batter will be thin after adding the water, but this is normal and helps create a moist cake.)

5. **Bake the Cake**:
   - Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
   - Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.

6. **Make the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting**:
   - In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with an electric mixer until creamy, about 1-2 minutes.
   - Sift in the powdered sugar and cocoa powder, then mix on low speed until combined.
   - Add the vanilla extract, a pinch of salt (if using), and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream or milk. Beat on medium-high speed until the frosting is smooth and fluffy. Add more cream or milk if the frosting is too thick, or more powdered sugar if it‚Äôs too thin.

7. **Assemble the Cake**:
   - Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a generous layer of chocolate frosting on top.
   - Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream.
   - Decorate as desired with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or fresh berries.

#### **Tips**:
- **Storage**: Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving for the best texture.
- **Boiling Water**: Adding boiling water to the batter helps bloom the cocoa powder, intensifying the chocolate flavor and creating a moist cake. Be cautious when mixing to avoid splashing.
- **Variations**: For an extra chocolatey kick, fold in ¬Ω cup of chocolate chips into the batter before baking. You can also use a ganache (melted chocolate and cream) as a topping instead of buttercream.
- **Room Temperature Ingredients**: Using room temperature eggs and milk helps the batter mix more evenly.
