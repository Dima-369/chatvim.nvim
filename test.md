### **Classic Vanilla Sponge Cake Recipe**

**Servings:** 8-10  
**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 25-30 minutes  
**Total Time:** About 45 minutes

#### **Ingredients:**

- 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour
- 1 Â½ cups (300g) granulated sugar
- Â½ cup (115g) unsalted butter (softened, at room temperature)
- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk
- 3 large eggs
- 2 Â½ teaspoons baking powder
- Â½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

#### **Equipment:**

- Two 8-inch (20cm) round cake pans (or one 9-inch pan for a single layer)
- Mixing bowls
- Whisk or electric mixer
- Spatula
- Parchment paper (optional, for lining the pans)

---

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pans:**

   - Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C).
   - Grease the cake pans with butter or non-stick spray. Optionally, line the
     bottom of the pans with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients:**

   - In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set
     aside.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugar:**

   - In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer (or a whisk) to beat the
     softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This
     should take about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add the Eggs and Vanilla:**

   - Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
   - Mix in the vanilla extract.

5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**

   - Gradually add half of the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix
     until just combined.
   - Add the milk and mix again.
   - Finally, add the remaining dry ingredients and mix until the batter is
     smooth. Be careful not to overmix.

6. **Pour into Pans:**

   - Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the top
     with a spatula.

7. **Bake the Cake:**

   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
     into the center comes out clean.
   - If using a single 9-inch pan, it may take a few minutes longer (check at 30
     minutes).

8. **Cool the Cake:**
   - Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes.
   - Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting or
     decorating.

#### **Optional Frosting Idea: Vanilla Buttercream**

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter (softened)
- 4 cups (480g) powdered sugar
- 1-2 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. Beat the butter until creamy.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing well.
3. Add the vanilla extract and milk, and beat until smooth and spreadable.
4. Spread or pipe the frosting onto the cooled cake.

#### **Tips:**

- **Storage:** Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for
  up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to a week.
- **Variations:** Add lemon zest, cocoa powder, or food coloring to the batter
  for different flavors or looks. You can also layer the cake with jam or fresh
  fruit.
- **Testing for Doneness:** If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, bake for
  an additional 5 minutes and check again.
