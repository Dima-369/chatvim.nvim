please write a short poem about typescript

# === ASSISTANT ===

Types swirl in declaration’s light,  
Scripted clear, both day and night.  
Promises, arrays, and guards,  
Tamed by strong, compiled cards.

Errors caught before they fly,  
Interfaces standing by.  
Syntax strict, yet gently kind—  
TypeScript brings us peace of mind.
